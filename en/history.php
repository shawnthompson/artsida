				<p>Artsida was originally launched as Project HOPE in late 2006 when founder Chris Elliott was looking for an opportunity to assist <abbr title="AIDS Community Care Montreal">ACCM</abbr>’s crucial work in the <abbr title="Human Immunodeficiency Virus">HIV</abbr>/<abbr title="Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome">AIDS</abbr> community.</p>
				<p>What began as a small fundraising effort to promote local artists and <abbr title="Human Immunodeficiency Virus">HIV</abbr>/<abbr title="Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome">AIDS</abbr> awareness soon took on more dynamic proportions by drawing the attention of celebrities such as Susan Aglukark, Joe Average, Tom Bianchi and Sharon Stone.</p>
<p>Galerie Dentaire agreed to host the Artsida exhibit for three weeks in 2008, which solidified a partnership that continues to this day. The auction itself has been held at renowned venues across Montreal, such as the Cabaret Lion d’Or, the St James United Church and the Montreal Contemporary Art Gallery. It has grown from raising $15,000 in its first iteration to $55,000 at Artsida 5.</p>
	<p>Throughout the years, Artsida has featured works donated by the stars of the Québec and Canadian art scenes, such as Kent Monkman, Daniel Barkley, Marie Danielle Leblanc, Yvon Goulet, Zilon, Scarlett Raven (a celebrated member of Damien Hirst’s Young British Artists group), and international artists including Christopher Campbell (Saatchi member - <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>); Irish artist Karl Mullen (Polk Museum), and American artist Ryan Cronin (Greenfield Foundation); as well as talented emerging Québecois artists like Steve Lévesque, Sébastien Astwo, Jean Pascal Fournier, Annie Langlois  and Marie Hélène Bellavance (acclaimed star of Sophie Deraspe’s film Vital Signs).</p>
