<h2><a target="_blank" href="http://entrepotsdominion.ca/">Entrepôts Dominion</a> (main auction)</h2>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://entrepotsdominion.ca/"><img src="img/venue-dominion.png" class="img-responsive pull-left mrgn-rght-md" alt="Entrepôts Dominion"></a>Les Entrepôts Dominion’s stunning architectural design was awarded the Special Jury Prize (Prix spécial du jury) by Créativité Montréal in 2007. Construction of the beautiful heritage building began in 1880 by the Merchants Manufacturing Company as the neighbourhood became an industrial centre in Canada with several sawmills, flourmills, tanneries and smelters. Not too far from the Atwater Market, easily accessible by metro and equipped with plenty of parking, the elegantly remodeled building makes the perfect backdrop for this major art event.</p>

<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.galeriedentaire.com/accueil.php"><img src="img/LaGalerie.png" class="img-responsive pull-left mrgn-rght-md" alt="La Galerie"></a>La Galerie is a unique and offbeat amalgamation of an art gallery and dental clinic that has been hosting Artsida’s immensely popular art exhibitions since 2008. Situated a few steps from Sainte-Catherine’s street, it has become a focal point for Montreal art openings and cultural events.</p>
