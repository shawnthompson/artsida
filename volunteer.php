<p>Volunteers are an important part of Artsida and there are a lot of ways to get involved!</p>
<p>Volunteers offer support on the event night by staffing the bar, the door, and the art packing station, as well as showcasing the art during the auction. Volunteers are also involved in the months leading up to the event by offering support in areas like social media and sponsorship development.</p>
<p>If you're interested in getting involved or want to hear more about our many volunteer opportunities please contact our Volunteer Coordinator, Andrea Kornacki, at <a href="mailto:volunteer@accmontreal.org">volunteer@accmontreal.org</a> or (514) 527-0928.</p>
