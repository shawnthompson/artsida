<h2>Conditions Of Sale </h2>
<h3>Live Auction</h3>
<p>In order to make bids, all bidders must fill in a Paddle Registration Form at the Registration Desk before the start of the live auction. Keep in mind that all artworks are subject to a reserve bid, a confidential amount that must be met for the lot to be sold. If your bid is successful, you must go to the Payment Desk before the end of the evening to pay by cash, Interac or by credit card. Title to the offered lot will then pass to you, and you will thereupon assume full risk and responsibility for the work purchased by you. If you are unable to pay at the conclusion of the auction, <abbr title="AIDS Community Care Montreal">ACCM</abbr> reserves the right to offer the art to the previous bidder if they are able to pay for it.</p>
<p>In the event of any dispute between bidders, a missed bid or doubt as to the validity of any bid, the auctioneer will have, at his discretion, the final authority either to determine the successful bidder or to re-offer and resell the work in dispute.</p>
<p>If any dispute arises after the auction, the Artisda record of the auction proceedings shall be conclusive.</p>
<h3>General Rules For Live Auction</h3>
